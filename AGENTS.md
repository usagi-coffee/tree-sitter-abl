## Project

- Tree-sitter grammar for OpenEdge ABL.

## Key paths

- `grammar.js`: core grammar rules.
- `grammar/core/{expressions,statements}.js`: core aggregation rules ($.\_statement, $.\_expression; mostly plumbing).
- `grammar/{expressions, statements}/index.js`: aggregator files that collect and re-export all rules from their respective categories.
- `grammar/expressions/*.js`: expression rules (available, locked, aggregate, conditional; non-core/non-shared specific expressions).
- `grammar/statements/*.js`: statements rules.
- `src/parser.c`, `src/grammar.json`, `src/node-types.json`: generated by `tree-sitter generate`.
- `src/scanner.c`: external scanner implementation.
- `test/corpus/`: tree-sitter corpus tests.
- `bindings/`: language bindings.

## Workflow

- Regenerate parser (needed after modifications):
  - `bun run generate`
- Run tests (runs generate before tests):
  - `bun run test`
- Parse a file (returns syntax tree):
  - `bun run parse <file>`
  - Example: `bun run parse example.p`
- Parse a snippet (returns syntax tree):
  - `bun run parse:snippet <direct syntax string>`
  - Example: `bun run parse:snippet 'a = b + c.'`
- Build native and wasm artifacts:
  - `bun run build` -> abl.so
  - `bun run build:wasm` -> tree-sitter-abl.wasm
- Prints global state count:
  - `bun run check`
- Retrieve syntax information from the language reference
  - `bun run reference <phrase from contents>`
  - Example: `bun run reference 'DEFINE VARIABLE statement'`: Returns reference for the define variable statement.
  - Example: `bun run reference 'DEFINE*'`: Returns all possible DEFINE entries (names only).
  - Example: `bun run reference '*statement'`: Returns all statements entries (names only).
  - Example: `bun run reference '*'`: Returns all entries (names only).

Strongly prefer using these commands as they have helpful side-effects like returning `STATE_COUNT` after success.

## Conventions

- Grammar changes without thorough corpus coverage and testing are unacceptable.
- Avoid creating a shared or generic code unless it is really a part of the core syntax, core grammar modifications require a confirmation unless experimenting.
- We intentionally duplicate modifiers and tunings at the statement level so that most of the statement-specific context lives in a single file. To support this, each statement defines its own `__<statement>_rules`, which are later aliased to `$.rule` where needed. This intentional duplication favors locality, readability, and conflict isolation over DRY abstractions.
- All statement-related modifiers, phrases, tunings that are not already part of core should be locally defined as `__<statement>_<rule>` rule and aliased to `$.<rule>`.
- Conflicts must be resolved structurally whenever possible. Adding a `conflicts` entry or using a `prec(` is a last resort and requires prior confirmation with a clear explanation of why structural fixes are insufficient. There is only one exception: if there is already a similar conflict added, you can add it freely (most likely `access_modifier`/`static_modifier`) branch.
- Your first solution should never be to try to add a precedence to keywords, if it's necessary give me an explanation and ask for a confirmation.
- Prefer `kw` (requires whitespace after the keyword) and `tkw` (does not require whitespace) to use in-place of `token(/keyword/i)` function whenever dealing with keywords.
- Treat `(ERROR)` and `(MISSING)` nodes in the test output aserrors that need to be fixed.
- Use compact rule formatting: keep one-line rules adjacent with no blank lines, avoid blank lines between consecutive one-line rules.
- The grammar should avoid permissive or catch-all rules that allow invalid syntax to be parsed successfully.
- ABL grammar is filled with optionals, be careful not to explode `tree-sitter`'s `STATE_COUNT`.
- Always check `STATE_COUNT` impacts and note the current `STATE_COUNT` cost for statements via leading comments in `grammar/core/statements.js`.
- Do not remove tests just to satisfy test passing, just fix the underlying issue.
- `src/scanner.c` modifications need regeneration before testing.

## Notes

- `bun` instead of `npm`.
- Successful tests print out current `STATE_COUNT` at the end.
- `bun run parse` and `bun run parse:snippet` do not regenerate the parser before parsing the code, unlike `bun run test`.
- Parser does not build after reaching the hard limit of 65,535 `STATE_COUNT` but bugs might occur at the top-end of the limit e.g `tree-sitter test` might return status `0` but produce no output at about ~63,000 `STATE_COUNT`.
- When using `alias`, `tree-sitter` handles undefined rules by using the property name as the symbol name so it's okay to alias to `$.something_that_wasn't defined`.
- Terminators like `terminator` or `terminator_dot` should never be visible in the syntax tree output.
- `kw` and `tkw` are passed down using argument, to access them unpack it inside the statement module e.g `module.exports = ({ kw, tkw })`.
